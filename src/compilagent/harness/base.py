"""Abstract harness contract — one shape both pydantic-ai and the Claude
Agent SDK implement.

The session drives setup (baseline compile, search-space derivation, tool
surface) and then hands control to the harness via `harness.run(request)`.
The harness drives the inner agent loop: it receives the toolset, exposes
each tool through its native surface (decorators / MCP), streams events
back, and dispatches tool calls by invoking `ToolDecl.handler(args)`. The
session reacts to `StreamEvent`s by emitting through its `ObservationSink`.

Vendor types (`pydantic_ai.messages.*`, `claude_agent_sdk.*`) appear only in
the integration adapters — never in this module or the session.
