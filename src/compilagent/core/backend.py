"""Abstract `Backend` protocol shared by every compiler integration.

The session, the toolset, the experiment log, and the observation UI all
program against this interface. Concrete implementations live under
`compilagent.integrations.<name>` (in-tree) or external packages (out-of-tree)
and self-register via `backend_registry.register(id, factory)`.

A backend is responsible for:

  - Describing its target device.
  - Declaring its artifact stages (e.g. ("ttir","ttgir","llir","ptx") for
    Triton, ("fx_graph","output_code","schedule_log","fusion_log") for
    Inductor) so the observation UI can label them generically.
  - Compiling a `WorkloadSpec` under a `Plan` of `Intervention`s.
  - Timing a workload's end-to-end execution.
  - Validating numerical correctness against a reference compile.
  - Deriving a `SearchSpace` of typed `Lever`s from analysis — no
    hand-coded values.
  - Validating and interpreting a `Plan` (so domain-specific rewriting like
    Triton's pass split lives here, not in the session).
  - Listing extra agent tools and artifact renderers it wants registered.

Backend-specific concepts (MLIR passes, inductor knobs, FX rewrites) are
encapsulated in the `Plan`/`Intervention` payloads; the session never
inspects them.

Out-of-tree integrations: implement the `Backend` protocol structurally
(no inheritance required) or inherit from `BackendBase` to skip the
no-op-defaultable methods. See `docs/integration_guide.md`.
