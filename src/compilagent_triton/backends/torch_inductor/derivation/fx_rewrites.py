"""FX-graph rewrite candidates derived from the captured FX module.

For each high-impact aten op observed in the captured FX graph (SDPA, softmax,
layer_norm, gelu, …), emit a `StructuredJsonRange` lever describing the rewrite
options known to be meaningful for that op. The set of levers comes from the
graph, not a hand-coded op list — though we keep a curated map of "interesting"
ops to their available rewrite recipes.

Rewrite payloads are passed to the backend as Python callables in the
intervention's payload (resolved by the agent runner's tool wrapper from a
dotted path); this module only declares the available levers.
